# ValentinesDay

An interactive "Will you be my Valentine?" page featuring three expressive chibi characters.

## How It Works

Open `index.html` in a browser. The page asks "Will you be my Valentine?" with two buttons:

- **Yes** - Shows a celebration screen with the flower-holding character, heart bursts, and confetti
- **No** - The button dodges away and the angry character pops up. The Yes button grows bigger each time!

## Characters

The three chibi characters are rendered as inline SVGs:

| Character | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Starry-Eyed | The main character asking the question, with big sparkly eyes |
| Angry/Tsundere | Pops up near the No button when the user tries to decline |
| Flower Love | Appears on the celebration screen holding a red bouquet |
